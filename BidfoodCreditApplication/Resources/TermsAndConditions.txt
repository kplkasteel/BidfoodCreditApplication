commercial nature and that possession of these securities is vested in the Seller;

respect of which payment has not been made at the date of the Purchaser becoming subject to such Credit Event, (whether

pursuant to which such goods were sold shall be deemed to have been cancelled in respect of the goods so returnable/
recoverable.

and converting from a proprietorship, partnership, or company to a close corporation or from a proprietorship, partnership or a
close corporation to a company at any time hereafter, as the case may be, any Guarantor shall nevertheless still remain

the Purchaser's financial position.
33 Any condonation of any breach of any of the provisions hereof or other act or relaxation, indulgence or grace on the part of
the Seller shall not in any way operate as or be deemed to be a waiver by the Seller of any rights hereunder, or be construed
as a novation thereof.

are found to be invalid or unenforceable, that clause/clauses shall not affect the balance of these Standard Terms and
Conditions, which shall remain of full force and effect.
